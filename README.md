## Composer authentication (private packages)

The SilverAssist packages this plugin uses (`wp-github-updater`, `wp-plugin-kernel`, `wp-settings-hub`, `coding-standards` and `wp-coding-standards`) are installed from their GitHub repositories through Composer `vcs` repositories declared in `composer.json` (with `"no-api": true`, so Composer reads tags with git and does not spend the GitHub API quota of the token), not from Packagist.org. Those repositories can require authentication, so configure a token before running `composer install`:

- **Locally:** `composer config --global github-oauth.github.com <token>`
- **CI:** store `{"github-oauth":{"github.com":"<token>"}}` as the repository secret `COMPOSER_AUTH`. The workflows already pass it to `composer install`.

Never commit a token or an `auth.json`.

**Updating from a private repository:** when the plugin's repository is private, the site needs a read-only token in the `SILVER_GITHUB_TOKEN` constant or environment variable so the updater can read the releases. A public repository needs no token.

```

#### 4. **Map Your Fields**
| Contact Form Field | API Parameter | Example |

| `[your-name]` | `name` | John Doe |
| `[your-email]` | `email` | john@example.com |
| `[your-phone]` | `phone` | +1234567890 |
| `[your-message]` | `message` | Hello world! |
